# GolfChamp-Github
This is an alpha version of what could potentially have been the terrain for our golfbot.
Due to lack of time, we couldn't implement this GUI into our project.

To get started:
- Have Java SDJ 11 installed
- Run the main function in the following directory: TerrainGen_Golfbot_v2/src/engineTester/MainGameLoop.java
- Use the keyboard arrows to navigate and the scroll wheel to zoom.
